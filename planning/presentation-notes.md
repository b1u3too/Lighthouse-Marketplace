## As a logged in user
### First login with user id 1
***Home Page*** (Andrea)

- I can filter items by price range
- I can click on the heart icon to add an item to my favorite page

***Individual listing Page***
- I can view the details of a listing -- Description and seller name
- I can message the seller (Send message from user 1 on the rubber ducky listing)

***My listings Page*** (April)
- I can view all the listings I created
- I can create an new listing --- The new item will be added to my listing page and home page
- I can edit a listing, too!
- I can mark an item as sold -- The item will still appear on my listing page but not on home page
- I can delete an item --- The item will be delete from the database

***Favorite Page***
- I can view all the listings I favorited
- I can remove a listing if I no longer like it
- If a listing was marked sold by seller, it will show as SOLD text instead of price

### Second Login with user id 5
***Message Page*** (Kaz) 
- I can view all the messages I received from the buyers about my listing (oh look, someone wants the duck!)
- I can reply to these messages through email, text, and in our app - errors on front end if the message is empty
- Note that the whole conversation with the person about the listing shows on one page

### Then login with user id 1 again
***Message Page***
- I can view my conversation with the seller and see his reply

## Conclusion (about 90 secs)
