## Question 
- Are we going to sell Lighthouses? :D We can add more filter depends on what we are going to sell!
Let's do it! (Andrea)

- Do we seperate user and admin? Like Nike shop? Admin -> Nike, customer -> users ? 
Or more like FB market and users can sell and buy? 
  - Monday April 25th -- Let's ask Taiwo tomorrow about this!
---> I am now assuming the first option since we are selling a specific item? 

- what if there's an "admin table" that relates to the user table? (So a person has to sign up as a user then... fill in extra or tick a box to become a "seller" -- we won't actually do that, just pretend it already happened with our seed data)

- Do we want to sell same multiple items? Need stock? Or each product is unique? (Let's skip stock -- since it's mostly a "Facebook Marketplace-y" vibe)

- Are we going to create message page? Or just provide contact info? (How about we put it as an textbox form a la' facebook messages)

- SPA or MPA ? 
  - How about MPA, pages
    - Buyers Browsing Page (Featured loads first, filter/search options)
    - Buyer Individual Item Page (messaging) -- think like TinyApp
    - Buyers's Favourites Page (like browse but better)

    - Seller "my Listings" Page (Create new post be a button that pops out (JQuery) a form)
    - Seller Individual Item Page (All seller edit features need to be - messaging) -- think like TinyApp Edit Page


- MVD? What should we demo? (we should talk about this together!)

-- MESSAGING: How do we pull off messaging in app? That's a new one! -- as is email/text functionality (Great Taiwo question)
